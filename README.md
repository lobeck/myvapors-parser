# myvapors-parser


This is a library to parse the database of myVapors.

It consists of a sample application (myvapors-database-to-csv) which export the database as csv (plain comma separated).

Additionally the parsing module can be included in other applications to further process the data (see myVaporsRecords.parser).

## About

I became disappointed with the functionality and usability of the myVapors App and tried to get the raw data for further processing, so i reverse engineered the file format.

Note: This just imports the myVapors database - there is no communication with the device (yet), so you'll have to use myVapors to download the statistics from the device first!
